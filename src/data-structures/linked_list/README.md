# [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

Linked list is a linear collection of data elements (nodes), wose order is not given by their physical placement in memory (unline Arrays). Instead each element points to the next.

It is a _data structure_ consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains __data__ and a __reference__ to the next node in the sequence.

This structure allows for __efficient insertion or removal__ of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. A __drawback is that access time is linear__. Faster access, such as random access (like Arrays) is not feasinble, therefore other data structures have better cache locality compared to linked list.

#### Problem with Array

Array size is static. We cannot decide the size of an array unless we know upfront how many elements we want to store.
