I'll briefly introduce you to basic concepts you need to understand
before studying data structure and algorithms.

### Data Structures

A program has to be brought into main memory for its execution, as well as data has to be
brought into main memory for its processing, so than program instructions can perform operations into data.

How do we organize data in main memory so that it can be efficiently utilized by
our applications?

We call _Data Structures_ to the _arrangement/collection__ of data items (in memory), so that they can be utilized efficiently during the execution of a program.

Therefore, Data Structures are formed in main memory, during the execution time of a program.

### Databases and Data Structures

When you are pulling data from storages (databases commonly use hard-disk), the data needs to be brough into main memory for its use during execution of a program, facing also the need of Data Structures.

### Stack Memory
