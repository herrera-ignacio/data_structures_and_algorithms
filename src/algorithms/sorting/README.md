# Sorting

| Algorithm      | Worst time | Average time | Space |
|----------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Bubble sort    | O(n^2)     | O(n^2)       | O(n)  |
| Insertion sort | O(n^2)     | O(n^2)       | O(1)  |
| Selection sort | O(n^2)     | O(n^2)       | O(1)  |
| Quick sort	 | O(n^2)     | O(n lg n)    | O(1)  | 

### Stable

A sorting algorithm is said to be __stable__ if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted

* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Bubble sort
* Counting sort
* Tim sort

### Unstable

* Heap sort
* Quick sort
* Shell sort
* Selection sort
